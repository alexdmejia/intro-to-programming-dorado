            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am someone who is passionate about systems thinking and development, as well as a deep interest
                                                 in computer knowledge since a very early age. I graduated from the University of Tennesee in Chattanooga in 2018 with a business and literature degree.
                                                 I have experience in coffee roasting management and development of small business design.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am in the process of a career change into website and front-end development because it is an area 
                                                of teamwork and creativity which I particularly enjoy and feel passionate about. I am currenly enrolled with Code the 
                                                Dream, a free intensive training in software and website development that help people from low-income and under-represented backgrounds.
